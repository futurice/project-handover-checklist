# project-handover-checklist

## Handover

When a new person joins a project, project members are changed, or project is moved to another team, a
handover should be thoroughly planned and executed.

### Why?

* Reduce handover time.
* Make clear for everyone how handover will affect schedules/communication/budget.
* Reduce risks of post-handover work.
* Ensure good confidence for new members.

Handover is not a task, and it is not instant. Handover is always a project. Therefore it should be planned
and executed like a project.
